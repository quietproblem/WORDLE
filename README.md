HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
--------------------------------------
Compile: g++ Wordle.cpp main.cpp
Run: ./a.out

--------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------
Wordle.h, rawData.txt must all be in the same directory as the Wordle.cpp files in order to compile. We also made use of a sys("cls") command which is system-dependent, however, the program should still run.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT
--------------------------------------
This was a simple implementation of the online game, Wordle created during HACK CU X (weekend of 3/2/2024-3/3/2024). We implemented a binary search tree for input validation as well as randomization.
